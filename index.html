		The bench press is an upper body strength training exercise that consists of pressing a weight upwards from a supine position. The exercise works the pectoralis major as well as supporting chest, arm, and shoulder muscles such as the anterior deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, scapulae fixers, trapezii, and the triceps. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.[1]

		The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting (alongside the deadlift and squat) and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting.

		It is also used extensively in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles.
